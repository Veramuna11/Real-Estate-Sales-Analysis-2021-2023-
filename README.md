# üè° Real Estate Sales Analysis (2021‚Äì2023)

A data analysis and visualization project focused on property sales trends across towns and property types, using Python and Tableau.

---

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project analyzes real estate sales in Connecticut from 2021 to 2023 using an extended version of a government-sourced dataset. The goal is to explore how property type, location, and timing influence sale amounts and market trends.

Python was used for data cleaning and feature engineering, while Tableau was used to build an interactive dashboard showing top towns by sales, pricing trends by property type, and sales performance over time. The final output helps investors, analysts, and planners better understand local market behavior as well help in making data-driven decisions in the housing market.



## üìà Objective
- Clean and preprocess raw real estate sales data using Python (Pandas).
- Develop key business insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Build a professional Tableau dashboard to visualize real estate sales trends.
- Focus analysis specifically on sales recorded between **2021 and 2023**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Source

- Original Dataset: [Data.gov - Real Estate Sales (2001‚Äì2018)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/real-estate-sales-2001-2018)
- File Format: **CSV** (`.csv`)
- Note: This analysis specifically focuses on sales recorded between **2021 and 2023**, extracted from an updated version of the dataset (`Real_Estate_Sales_2001-2022_GL.csv`).


---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **Python**: Used for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering (via Pandas and NumPy).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Served as the development environment for step-by-step data exploration and EDA.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to visualize distributions and trends before dashboarding.
- **Tableau**: Built the final interactive dashboard to present KPIs, sales patterns, and geospatial insights.
- **GitHub**: Version control and documentation for code, data, and visuals.
- **Markdown**: For writing this project documentation in a clean, readable format.


---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Processing
- Loaded dataset with 100,416 records and 14 columns.
- Converted `Date Recorded` to datetime format.
- Created `Recorded Year` and `Recorded Month` columns.
- Cleaned missing values:
  - Dropped sparse columns like `OPM remarks` and `Assessor Remarks`.
  - Filled missing values in `Residential Type` and `Non Use Code` with "Unknown."
- Extracted `Latitude` and `Longitude` from `Location` column for geospatial analysis.
- Created new engineered features:
  - `Price per $1k Assessed`
  - `Log Sale Amount` (for better distribution visualization)

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the exploratory phase, several key questions were investigated to better understand Connecticut's real estate market between 2021 and 2023.

---

### üîπ Key Analytical Questions:

- What are the top towns by the number of sales and total sale value?
- How do average sale amounts differ across property types?
- What is the overall trend in sales volume over the years?
- How is the distribution of sale amounts shaped ‚Äî is it skewed or uniform?
- How do sales amounts relate to assessed values?
- Where are sales geographically concentrated?

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the top towns by number of sales and total sale value?


![top_towns_by_sales](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d40896f-416b-4f9b-8836-2d88069764c5)


This chart highlights the towns with the highest volume of real estate transactions from 2021 to 2023:

- **Waterbury**, **Stamford**, and **Bridgeport** top the list, suggesting a highly active housing market in these urban centers.
- Other towns like **Norwalk**, **New Haven**, and **Hamden** also show strong transaction activity, likely due to their population size, rental markets, or accessibility.
- These areas represent **high-turnover zones**, where homes are bought and sold more frequently, possibly indicating affordability or higher mobility.

**Insight**:  
These towns are key hotspots for agents, rental investors, or developers looking for active markets with steady transaction flow.




![top_towns_by_total_value](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b09c2b2-610a-4f74-8862-1c7d843476a4)

### üí∞ Top 10 Towns by Total Sale Value

This chart focuses on where the **most money was exchanged** in real estate sales:

- **Stamford**, **Greenwich**, and **Westport** dominate in total sales value, signaling high property prices and a wealthier buyer base.
- Towns like **Darien**, **New Canaan**, and **Norwalk** follow closely ‚Äî areas known for upscale residential neighborhoods.
- These towns may not lead in transaction volume but make up for it with **fewer, high-priced properties**.

**Insights**:  
Ideal for investors targeting **luxury real estate**, high returns per property, or long-term appreciation in affluent markets.


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do average sale amounts differ across property types?

![avg_sale_by_property_type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b68f41d-7ec6-4cdd-85b5-e4f92c31870e)

- **Apartments** had the highest average sale amounts, followed by **Industrial** and **Commercial** properties.
- **Residential** and **Vacant Land** types were more frequent but had significantly lower sale averages.
- This suggests that higher-end properties are concentrated in specialized property types like Apartments and Commercial real estate.


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the overall trend in sales volume over the years?

![sales_per_year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1267d5-e9d9-432d-b382-577b9627b740)


- Sales volume **peaked in 2022**, possibly due to economic rebound after COVID restrictions and favorable interest rates.
- **2021** had the lowest volume, and **2023** saw a slight decline, suggesting possible market normalization or affordability constraints.


---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How is the distribution of sale amounts shaped ‚Äî is it skewed or uniform?

![log_sale_amount_distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7516d6f7-ef33-45f9-a316-65cf994e2431)


- The **log distribution** of sale amounts forms a roughly **bell-shaped curve**, but with a **right-skew**, meaning most properties fall under the mid-range, with a few high-value outliers.
- This highlights a need to use log transformations when modeling or summarizing the data to reduce the effect of outliers.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do sales amounts relate to assessed values?

![sale_vs_assessed_value](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4bfcfb8-b80c-49d4-9aaa-0a0d3d3c4a42)


- A **positive correlation** is visible: properties with higher assessed values tend to sell for more.
- However, there is a **wide spread**, indicating potential discrepancies in property valuations or negotiation power.
- Useful for identifying **undervalued or overvalued** properties.
---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Where are sales geographically concentrated?

![sales_geographical_concentration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefbfc57-95fb-40d3-aa74-5512aa7572b7)


- Sales are **highly concentrated in the southern and coastal towns**, especially around urban hubs like **Stamford**, **Bridgeport**, and **Norwalk**.
- Central and rural parts of Connecticut show fewer transactions, consistent with population density and development levels.

---

## üìà Insights & Findings

- Urban towns dominate both in volume and total value
- Apartments and Industrial properties lead in pricing, while Residential types dominate frequency(Sales).
- Temporal and geographic patterns highlight **when** and **where** investment opportunities may exist.
- The **Sales Ratio** (Assessed Value vs Sale Amount) varies heavily by town.
- 2022 marked the market's peak post-pandemic.
- Sales were heavily concentrated in major urban centers like Stamford and Greenwich.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Analyze external factors (e.g., mortgage rates, economic indicators) alongside sales.
- Predict future sale amounts using machine learning models.
- Expand analysis to more years and compare pre-pandemic vs post-pandemic trends.
